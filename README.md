# AmericanReels
A lottery app intended to engage the modern American with daily rewards, betting, &amp; simple payment processing

This was my original project proposal:
“The goal of this independent study is to explore how gamification techniques can be applied to UI/UX design to improve user engagement, satisfaction, and retention. The study will focus on designing gamified interface elements, such as reward systems, progress trackers, and responsive feedback in an app.” 
  
When I first began to conceptualize this project, I began familiarizing myself with Xcode using a practice file, video tutorials, blog tips & tricks. Eventually I settled on a game idea: an American theme lottery app inspired by the many Fanduel Ads I see online. There are very few casino apps in the market, so I wanted to see if I could create something unique. I expanded on this idea by creating a Mood Board. 

During that first phase, I learned about:
- Setting up in Xcode
- Assets
- Separate views
- Hstack, Vstack, Zstack
- Different documentation importing and languages, mainly Swift UI

Next, I created wireframes in Figma. Translating my wireframe designs into real code felt like a daunting task. I decided to do the coding phase in a very incremental, step-by-step approach. 

In order to maintain momentum, these are the steps that I outlined for myself:
1. Code game basics (login page, setting up views, basic content)
  - This helped me familiarize with the coding language (if/else statements, bool, strings) and troubleshooting errors
2. Develop a working 3-slot random generator
  - This showed me that game logic is very complicated and setting standards like timers, true/false responses, and deadlines are valuable for consistent functionality.
3. Code UI basics (increase/decrease bet amount, Success message, Reward quest position updated every 24 hours)
  - These are ideas that chatgpt helped me integrate into my code. I realize that chatgpt can make mistakes, but is also good at revising based on feedback. This tool definitely helped speed up some of my most tedious tasks.
4. Color and Personalize
  - This was nice practice working in the assets and realizing how developers translate static designs into working code. Some of my ideas seemed much simpler in theory but became complicated in code. I made lots of stylistic compromises.

If I had more time, I would add some bright animations like fireworks, background music, connect to a payment processor, and improve the contrast between the light/dark mode.
